# BAM-matcher #

A simple tool for determining whether two [BAM files](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) contain reads sequenced from the same sample or patient by counting genotype matches at common SNPs.

BAM-matcher is most useful at comparing whole-genome-sequencing (WGS), whole-exome-sequencing (WES) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) human data, but can also be customised to compare panel data or non-human data.

Once configuration file is setup, to compare two bam files (sample1.bam and sample2.bam) just run:
```
bam-matcher.py -B1 sample1.bam -B2 sample2.bam
```

which will give an output like:
```

BAM1:	sample1.bam 
BAM2:	sample2.bam 
depth threshold: 15

## Dependencies ##

**Python** 

(version 2.7)

**Python libraries**

* PyVCF
* ConfigParser

## Installation ##

```
cd /directory/path/where/bam-matcher/is/to/be/installed/
git clone https://bitbucket.org/sacgf/bam-matcher.git
```

This provides:

## Configuration ##

BAM-matcher requires a configuration file. If the default configuration file is missing, a template can be generated by the ```--generate-config (-G)``` function. 

```
BAM-matcher.py --generate-config path_to_file_to_be_generated
```

For detailed instruction on how to set up a configuration file, see the [wiki page](https://bitbucket.org/sacgf/bam-matcher/wiki/Configuration).

Most configuration settings can also be overridden at run time.




The repository includes 3 VCF files which can be used for comparing human data (hg19/GRCh37). 

These VCF files also contain variants extracted from 1000 Genomes project which are all exonic and have high likelihood of switching between REF and ALT alleles (global allele frequency between 0.45 and 0.55). The only difference between them is the number of variants contained within.

The repository also includes several BAM files which can be used for testing (under test_data directory), as well as the expected results for various settings.

See the [tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/sacgf/bam-matcher/wiki/Usage) for details on how to test BAM-matcher using the example data.

# Running BAM-matcher #

If configured correctly, to compare two bam files, you just need to run:

```
bam-matcher.py --bam1 sample1.bam --bam2 sample2.bam -o output_report.txt
```

For detailed information on runtime arguments and parameters, see the [wiki page](https://bitbucket.org/sacgf/bam-matcher/wiki/Arguments).

See the [tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/sacgf/bam-matcher/wiki/Usage) on how to test BAM-matcher using the example data.
