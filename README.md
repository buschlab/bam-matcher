# BAM-compare #

A tool for determining whether two BAM files were sequenced from the same sample or patient. 

## Introduction ##

When working with large sets of next generation sequencing data from multiple patients and sample, sometimes it's possible to mislabel samples during any part of the process, whether working with physical samples or electronic data.

BAM-compare provides a quick way to determine whether two BAM files originated from the same patient, by comparing the genotype at positions that are reported to have high level of variation.
